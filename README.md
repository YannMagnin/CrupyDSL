This project provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) with help on
rewriting Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

This project helps me to maintain the grammar of my own language "CrupyLang" by
only focusing on grammar rules and not maintaining the front-end parser
(which is generated by this project)

## Building

Using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```

## Example

You can find two examples in the `CrupyDSL/examples/` folder, but here an extract of the `crupyjson`.<br>
You can also find the
[whole DSL grammar source code](https://github.com/YannMagnin/CrupyDSLParser/blob/master/CrupyDSL/crupydsl/grammar/_dsl/_parser/__init__.py#L69)
if you really want to use this project (which I do not recommend for now)

```python
## define the grammar

class _CrupyDSLGrammarJSON(CrupyGrammarBase):
    """ define JSON grammar using Crupy DSL
    """
    production_entry    = 'json'
    grammar             = r"""
        <json>      ::= <statement> <sp> :eof:
        <statement> ::= <primitive> | <container>

        <primitive> ::= :number: | <string> | <boolean> | <nullable>

        <container> ::= <object> | <array>
        <array>     ::= <sp> '[' <sp> <statement> (<sp> ',' <sp> <statement>)* <sp> ']' <sp>
        <object>    ::= <sp> '{' <sp> <member> ( <sp> ',' <sp> <member>)* <sp> '}' <sp>
        <member>    ::= <string> <sp> ':' <sp> <statement>

        <sp>        ::= (:space_newline:)*
        <boolean>   ::= 'true' | 'false'
        <nullable>  ::= 'null'
        <string>    ::= '"'...'"' | "'"..."'"
    """

## main

jsonast = _CrupyDSLGrammarJSON().parse('{"test": oui}')
```
